You’re thinking about this exactly the Tufte way already, so let’s be precise and disciplined.

Below is a real, non-hand-wavy design for a Tufte-style output: structure, visual cues, semantic color meaning, and why each element earns its ink.

1. First principle (Tufte lens)

Show comparisons, not decoration.
Encode meaning in position, density, and proximity.
Color is annotation, not ornament.

So this is not:

charts for charts’ sake

rainbow tables

dashboards

This is:

calm, dense summaries

marginal notes

ratios that tell stories

structure doing most of the work

2. The primary structure (what replaces the big table)
Instead of a language table → a Responsibility Ledger
Codebase Summary
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total files: 493        Total LOC: 126k        Languages: 7

Responsibility Breakdown (LOC)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
prod        ████████████████████████ 62.1k
test        ████████████             29.4k
infra       ██████                   14.2k
docs        ████                     11.5k
config      ██                        6.1k
generated   █                         2.7k


Why this is Tufte-correct

No axes

No legend

Bars are aligned to meaningful categories

Exact numbers are printed (no estimation required)

This answers the first real question:

“What kind of work is this repo made of?”

3. Secondary structure: ratios (the real insight)

Immediately follow with ratios, not more counts.

Key Ratios
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Test / Prod           0.47    (healthy baseline ≈ 0.5–0.8)
Infra / Prod          0.23    (rising operational complexity)
Docs / Prod           0.18    (well-documented)
Generated / Prod      0.04    (low automation reliance)


Why this matters

Humans reason in ratios

Ratios survive repo growth

Ratios tell stories over time

No visualization beats a clean number with context.

4. Tertiary structure: small multiples (by language)

This is where you earn density.

Language Composition by Responsibility
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Go        prod ████████████████ 49.2k   test ████████ 18.9k
MDX       docs ████████████     11.1k
Shell     infra ████████         9.4k
YAML      infra ██████           6.8k


Rules:

No totals repeated

Only roles that matter per language

Silence where irrelevant

This avoids the classic mistake: showing empty categories.

5. Semantic color: what it means (and what it must not do)
Semantic colors are role markers, not row highlights.

They answer:

“What responsibility am I looking at?”

They do not:

differentiate languages

decorate tables

compete with text

Proposed semantic palette (terminal-safe, low saturation)
Role	Intent	Color behavior
prod	Core value	default foreground
test	Safety	muted green / blue
infra	Operational risk	amber / copper
docs	Knowledge	soft gray
config	Fragility	gray-blue
generated	Low ownership	faint gray
deprecated	Risk	desaturated red

Important:
Color should only appear on labels, never on numbers.

Bad:

███████ 49.2k  (green)


Good:

test ████████ 18.9k


Text carries the meaning; color whispers it.

6. Marginalia (this is very Tufte)

Use side annotations, not banners.

infra ██████ 14.2k
        ↑ 42% of infra LOC is CI/CD


Or:

test ████████████ 29.4k
     note: 81% unit, 11% integration, 8% e2e


These are:

optional

precise

non-interrupting

They reward close reading without demanding it.

7. Sparklines (only where time exists)

If you have history, add one line:

Test / Prod Ratio (last 12 months)
▁▂▃▄▆▆▇▇▆▆▇▇


Rules:

No axes

No legend

Label once: “upward trend since Q2”

This answers:

“Are we improving, drifting, or decaying?”

8. File-level cues (micro-insight, zero clutter)

When drilling into a directory or file list:

auth/
  login.go              412   prod
  login_test.go         688   test
  jwt.go                931   prod   ⚠ hot path
  mock_identity.go      201   test:fixture


Only one icon max, only when meaningful.

No emojis.
No rainbows.
No dashboards.

9. What this deliberately avoids (important)

A Tufte-correct design does not:

show pie charts

use stacked bars without numbers

repeat totals

encode meaning solely in color

force legends

If a legend is required, the design failed.

10. The meta-insight

What you’re really building is:

A calm narrative about responsibility, risk, and maturity.

Not:

“How big is this repo?”
But:

“What kind of work dominates?”

“Where does risk accumulate?”

“Is investment balanced?”

That’s why this feels missing in existing tools—they optimize for measurement, not understanding.
